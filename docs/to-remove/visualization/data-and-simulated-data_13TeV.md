# Data and Simulated Data

## Data

The ATLAS collaboration has released 10 inverse femtobarns of data.
Ten inverse femtobarns correspond to approximately 1000 trillion proton-proton collisions.

The ATLAS datasets are available on this website and on the [CERN open data portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/education/ATLAS).

## Simulated data

Simulated data, commonly named Monte Carlo (MC), are a key feature for the LHC experiments. These events are simulated using current theoretical models and are used to compare theory with real data.

### The full simulation requires the following steps

* **Event generation**: Hadronic final states using the proton-proton collisions are generated using programs relying on theoretical calculations, phenomenological models and experimental inputs.

* **Detector Simulation**: Interaction of the generated particles inside the ATLAS detector is simulated.

* **Digitisation**: The detector response is derived from the particle interactions and it is written in a format compatible with the real output of the detector. In addition, because of the high rate of collisions in the LHC, digitised signals from several simulated events can be piled-up to create samples with a realistic experimental background.

* **Reconstruction**: Particle trajectories and energies from the detector are reconstructed. Such final samples are used by the physicists.

### Comparing real data and simulated data

Real data and simulated data do not always agree. This can be due to various reasons, such as

* the conditions not being exactly the same e.g. Energy, pile-up.

* not all background processes are included in the simulated data,

* the physics has not been exactly modeled by the theory.

If the data and simulated data does not agree, it is important that physicists understand why.
