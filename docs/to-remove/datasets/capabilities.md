# General capabilities of the released 13 TeV Open Datasets

The publicly released 13 TeV Open Datasets can be used for educational purposes with different levels of task difficulty. 

At a **beginner level**, one could visualise the content of the datasets and produce simple distributions. An **intermediate-level** task would consist of making histograms with collision data after some basic selection. **Advanced-level** tasks would allow for a deeper look into the ATLAS data, with possibilities of measuring real event properties and physical quantities.

A non-exhaustive list of **possible tasks** with the proposed datasets include: 

+ comparisons of several distributions of event variables for simulated signal and background events; 
+ finding variables that are able to separate signal from background (jet multiplicity, transverse momenta of jets and leptons, lepton
isolation, b-tagging, missing transverse energy, angular distributions);
+ development and modification of cuts on these variables in order to enrich the signal-over-background separation; 
+ optimisation of the signal-over-background ratio and estimation of the purity based on simulation only; 
+ comparisons of the selection efficiency between data and simulation.

**Advanced-level tasks** might include: 

+ derivation of production cross sections and masses of objects;
+ reconstruction of the objects (quarks or bosons) by assigning the detector physics objects (jets, leptons, missing energy) to the hypothetical decay trees; 
+ estimation of the impact of other sources of systematic uncertainties (luminosity uncertainty, b-tagging efficiency, background modelling) by adding approximate and conservative values.
+ a test-bed for new data-analysis techniques, e.g. kinematic fitting procedures, multivariate discrimination of signal from background and other machine learning tasks.
