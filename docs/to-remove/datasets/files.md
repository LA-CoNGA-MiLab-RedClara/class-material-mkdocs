# Datasets in ROOT format

This section shows a simplified filter where to download the samples. You can filter by the collection, if recorded data (derived) or MonteCarlo (simulated), and some physics categories.

## Collections
| Description | Name  | link to ZIP file |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| events selected with at least one lepton (electron or muon) and exactly one large-Radius jet (R = 1.0) | 1largeRjet1lep | [5.5 Gb](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/1largeRjet1lep.zip)        |
| events selected with exactly one lepton (electron or muon). This is a very large collection, so, it was divided into three ZIP files| 1lep | [17 Gb](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/Data-1lep.zip), [20 Gb](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/MC-1-1lep.zip), [21 Gb](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/MC-2-1lep.zip) |
| events selected with exactly one lepton (electron or muon) and exactly one hadronic-reconstructed tau | 1lep1tau | [1.3 Gb](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/1lep1tau.zip)   |
| events selected with at least two leptons (electron or muon) | 2lep | [24 Gb](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/2lep.zip)   |
| events selected with exactly three leptons (electron or muon) | 3lep | [1.0 Gb](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/3lep.zip)   |
| events selected with at least four leptons (electron or muon) | 4lep | [427 Mb](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/4lep.zip)   |
| events selected with at least two photons | GamGam | [1.5 Gb](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/GamGam.zip)   |
