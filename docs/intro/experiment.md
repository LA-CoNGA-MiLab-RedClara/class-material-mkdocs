# **ATLAS detector at the LHC**

A [particle detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_detector) is a device used to detect, track, and/or identify ionising particles, such as those produced by nuclear decay, cosmic radiation, or reactions in a particle accelerator. The [ATLAS detector](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08003) at the LHC is a multipurpose particle detector with a forwardâ€“backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and nearly full coverage in solid angle. The name ATLAS is an acronym for "A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS" given that the magnetic field is produced by [toroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroid) magnets. 

The layout of the ATLAS detector is presented below:

It consists of an inner tracking detector (ID), electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer. The inner detector, including the insertable B-layer, provides charged-particle tracking from [silicon pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_pixel_detector) and microstrip detectors in the central region, surrounded by a [transition radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_radiation) tracker that enhances electron identification. 

The ID is surrounded by a thin [superconducting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity) solenoid providing an axial 2 T magnetic field, and by a fine-granularity lead/liquid-argon electromagnetic [calorimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorimeter_(particle_physics)), which provides energy measurements of electromagnetic showers. 

Hadron calorimetry is also based on the sampling technique, with either scintillator tiles or [liquid argon](https://atlas.cern/discover/detector/calorimeter) as the active medium and with steel, copper or tungsten as the absorber material. 

An extensive muon spectrometer with an air-core toroid magnet system surrounds the calorimeters. It includes three layers of high-precision
tracking chambers. The field integral of the toroid magnets ranges from 2.0 to 6.0 Tm across most of the detector.

The ATLAS detector is split into a barrel part, where detector layers are positioned on cylindrical surfaces around the beam axis, and two end-cap parts, where detector layers are positioned in planes perpendicular to the beam pipe.
