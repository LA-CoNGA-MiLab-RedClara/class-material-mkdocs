# 13 TeV ATLAS Open Data Jupyter ROOTbooks

The release of the 13 TeV ATLAS Open Data is accompanied by a set of Jupyter notebooks that allow data analysis to be performed directly in a
web browser by integrating the ROOT framework with the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) technology, a combination called "ROOTbook".

Several notebooks with analysis examples and an interface to launch the framework mentioned above, are available using [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch/) (Service for Web based ANalysis) and [Binder](https://mybinder.org) executable platforms.

The Jupyter ROOTbooks are split into two kinds of types: single analysis examples and full framework interfaces.
